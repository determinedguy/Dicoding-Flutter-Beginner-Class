# final_project

This is my final project for Dicoding Indonesia's class of "Belajar Membuat Aplikasi Flutter untuk Pemula".

## Usage

Currently (14 May 2021), my idea is to make a motivational app which the user can input their name and motivational messages will appear with their name on the next page. There will also be an "about me" page, which will make the amount of the pages to be three.

Checklist:

- Stateful Widget (such as Row or Column) -> ✅, will show "loving" memes as grid (?)

- Stateless Widget (such as inputs) ->  ✅, will receive user's name as input

- At least have two pages -> ✅, will have three pages

- Using Navigation -> ✅ for moving between pages

- Don't have the same UI as the **codelab** project
